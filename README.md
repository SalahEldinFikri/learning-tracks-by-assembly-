## Aim:
Writing a learning program to learning you about { Data_Science, Flutter, Back_end, Front_end}.

## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs , labtop.
2.  GUI Turbo Assembler x64 V.

## Here i will explain the program :
### First i will run it this will apper to me :

simple interface, You have to choose one of the choices:

1--> Data_Science 

2--> Back_end

3--> Flutter

4--> Front_end

### After you choose the track you will face another interface that include the following:

here i choose 1 (Data_Science).

now you have three choices:

1--> The Roadmap to the track.

2--> A small Quiz to test yourself.

3--> or going back.

### After Chosing one, If you choose the quiz you will get a small quiz that include 8..9 Q. You must answer the question right before going to the next one if you answer all the question right you will get a "congratulations" sign, Else if you answer any question wrong the program will interrupt by a "Wrong massege" and you will have to choose to exit or going back to the first interface:

And you will have a choose to go back or exit the program.
